## 1. General Course Information

### 1.1. Course Details

Coordinating Unit: School of Biosystem and Biomedical Science, College of Health Science
Level: Undergraduate 

### 1.2. Course Introduction

Statistics is fundamental in modern biology because it is integral in the design, analysis, and interpretation of experiments. The main aim of the course is to develop data science and hands-on programming skills in high-throughput biological research. The course will introduce concepts and hand-on skills that can help you tackle real-world data analysis challenges. 

This class contains hands-on coding exercise in every lecture, so please bring your laptop for the class (노트북 필수)

## 2. Aims, Objectives & Graduate Attributes

### 2.1 Course Aims

The aim of this course is to familiarize students with the discipline of biostatistics and basic analytic skills. Students will develop an appreciation of modern application in biostatistics while gaining a detailed understanding of the analytic fundamentals from data modality to programming language. Over the semester, students will be placed into hardcore training in programming exercise. We are learning R and UNIX for statistical computing and graphics. 


### 2.2 Learning Objectives
After successfully completing this course you should be able to:

1. Understand the basic programming for statistical analysis in genomic data

2. Understand the basic concepts for modern genomic research

3. Become confident in using R for genomics analyses

4. Gain hand-on experience in data visualization and wrangling
